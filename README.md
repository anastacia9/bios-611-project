# bios-611-project
Hello and welcome to my class project for BIOS 611!
I will study temporal changes in rainfall and crop production across all states and territories of India. I will also see whether and how they may be related. The results will help inform environmental policy and they will shed light on what we can expect to see in the future.
These data can be accessed through kaggle:
